# Pull Request: Initial Implementation of Math-Solving Agent

## Summary
This pull request includes the initial implementation of the advanced critical math-solving agent. The following components have been developed and integrated:

- **Problem Generation Module**: Functions to generate algebra and calculus problems.
- **Problem Solving Module**: Functions to solve algebra and calculus problems using SymPy.
- **Learning Module**: A reinforcement learning module with a Q-learning algorithm to improve problem-solving strategies over time.

## Changes
- Added `src/problem_generation.py` with functions to generate algebra and calculus problems.
- Added `src/problem_solving.py` with functions to solve algebra and calculus problems.
- Added `src/learning_module.py` with a Q-learning based reinforcement learning loop.
- Created initial test scripts in the `tests/` directory for each module.
- Documented the architecture and design in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Checklist
- [x] Implemented problem generation functions for algebra and calculus.
- [x] Implemented problem-solving functions for algebra and calculus.
- [x] Developed a reinforcement learning module with Q-learning.
- [x] Created initial test scripts for each module.
- [x] Documented the architecture and design.

## Notes
- The code was written without testing. Please review and test the changes.
