# Advanced Critical Math-Solving Agent Architecture

## Overview
The advanced critical math-solving agent is designed to handle a wide range of mathematical problems, including algebra, calculus, statistics, differential equations, and numerical analysis. The agent is capable of creating and solving its own problems with self-reinforcement learning capabilities. The architecture of the agent is divided into several key components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the agent's functionality.

## Components

### 1. Problem Generation Module
The Problem Generation Module is responsible for generating new math problems. It uses various mathematical libraries and algorithms to create problems across different areas of mathematics. This module ensures a diverse set of problems for the agent to solve and learn from.

### 2. Problem Solving Module
The Problem Solving Module contains the logic to solve the problems generated by the Problem Generation Module. It leverages mathematical libraries and custom algorithms to find solutions. This module is designed to handle complex mathematical computations and provide accurate solutions.

### 3. Learning Module
The Learning Module analyzes the performance of the Problem Solving Module, using reinforcement learning techniques to improve the problem-solving strategies over time. This module enables the agent to learn from its experiences and enhance its capabilities.

### 4. User Interface
The User Interface provides a simple and intuitive way for users to interact with the agent. Users can submit problems, receive solutions, and view the agent's progress. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and accessible.

### 5. Database/Storage
The Database/Storage system is used to store generated problems, solutions, and learning data. This system tracks the agent's progress and facilitates the learning process by providing historical data for analysis.

### 6. Integration with Mathematical Libraries
The agent is integrated with several mathematical libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, and Matplotlib. These libraries provide the necessary tools for numerical computations, scientific computing, symbolic mathematics, and plotting.
